How to Run
==========

Please make sure you have Node, NPM and NEO4J on your system (please consult your operating system's package manager).

Once they're installed then install grunt globally :

> npm install grunt -g

Once that's done, you should be able to go to the application directory and run the following :

> grunt ks-init
> grunt ks-start

This will pull down the latest source code, run an npm install of all the deps and then start the neo4j server and
run the server.

The application is now available at : 

> http://localhost:3001

In all it's shining glory :)
