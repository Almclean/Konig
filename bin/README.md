GenerateData.py
-------------
This is a very basic script to generate a set of random data (Parties, Locations, Ratings and Accounts) in the cql format for testing.

This takes two parameters:
   * The number of accounts to create
   * The location of the data file with init data (should be under resources/sampleData)

This use Python 3.4. The assumption here is the .py gives you a hint as to how to run this.
